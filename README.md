# ubCode Feature Planning

The [ubCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=useblocks.ubcode) VS Code extension is a productivity tool for working with
[Sphinx-Needs](https://sphinx-needs.readthedocs.io) projects.

The documentation for ubCode can be accessed [here](https://ubcode.useblocks.com).

This public repo exists to track issues for the private repos.
Users can create issues, track progress, vote for issues and see the milestone planning.

Some guidelines for creating issues:

- Please do not share company internal code or information. This repository is public.
- If you think you found a bug, please provide a minimal reproducible example if possible.
- Please search for existing issues before creating a new one to avoid duplicates.
- Use upvote reactions to show interest in an issue. Do not post "+1" comments.
- If you have urgent request, consider reaching out directly to our
  [support](mailto:support@useblocks.com?subject=[GitHub]%20ubCode%20Support%20Request).
- Please understand that creating issues does not guarantee that they will be implemented in a
  specific timeframe or at all. We gather feedback and wishes from multiple sources and prioritize
  them internally.

Thank you for your help in making ubCode better!
